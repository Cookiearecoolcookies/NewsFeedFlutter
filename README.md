A dummy project in 1 hour to test what flutter can do. I like testing out new frameworks in my spare time, if you have a framework which you would like tested please comment on this repo.

### Notes
- Remember to add a `key.properties` file in `/android` like:
```
storePassword=XXX
keyPassword=XXX
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=XXXX/upload-keystore.jks
```
- The App has not been tested on IOS
- The API key has been removed please get a new one from newsapi.org
